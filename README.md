## Overview


![RhNet_preview](images/preview.png)
 
The RhNet model is a convolutional neural network aimed to predict the pressure 
and temperature dependent gas/solvent weight fraction in a (swollen) polymer. 
Prediction is based on 3D images of electron density distributions in a solvent
molecule and in a polymer monomer/oligomer. Basically it combines two key 
ideas:
- to use a CNN to process electron density distribution and generate 
features to be fed to a dense network (see for example 
[Prediction of Energetic Material Properties from Electronic Structure Using 
3D Convolutional Neural Networks](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00259)) 
- to concatenate arrays of a polymer and a solvent features and an array of 
experimental conditions and feed them to a dense network (see for example 
[Machine Learning for Polymer Swelling in Liquids](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsapm.0c00586))

Generally, the resulting architecture resembles some face recognition and face
verification models (see for example 
[this lecture by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/convolutional-neural-networks/face-verification-and-binary-classification-xTihv))

## Quick Start (with NVIDIA Docker)

### Requirements
 
The repository contains a Dockerfile which adds RhNet dependencies over
a TensorFlow NGC container. To run an NGC container one will need:
- [NVIDIA Docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)
- Volta/Turing/Ampere and higher-based GPU
 
For more information on NGC containers and their compatibility refer 
to [NVIDIA Container Support Matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/support-matrix/index.html).
 
### Setup
 
1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shorku/rhnet
   cd rhnet
   ```
 
2. Build the NGC container with additional layers
     
   ```bash
   sudo docker build -t rhnet .
   ```
  
   The NGC container encapsulates Python, TensorFlow and other necessary 
   components optimized for usage on NVIDIA hardware. `docker build` will
   automatically download specified in `Dockerfile` image of an NGC container,
   install some additional python modules and copy the whole current directory
   with the rhnet script.

   **Note**, *the quantum-chemical data may be really huge. Make sure there is 
   no  quantum-chemical data within the current folder while building rhnet 
   image, otherwise it will be also copied.* 

   **Note**, *Current models and related routines were prepared with 
   TensorFlow 2.5.0 which runs only with numpy<=1.21. On the other hand 
   TensorFlow Model Optimization requires numpy=>1.23. An ugly solution is
   to forcefully install numpy==1.21 after the requirements are installed,
   which is done while building docker container. Somehow it works. I will try 
   to move to a newer TensorFlow version some time later*


3. Download or generate the data

   * Pre-trained model (multikernel option) can be downloaded from 
   a [separate repository](https://github.com/Shorku/rhnet_models/raw/main/multikernel.tar.xz) 
   (18,5 MB)
   * Experimental data and other necessary tables for the RhNet to perform 
   training and inference are in the `rhnet/data` folder. The only exception
   are the electron densities. 
   * Electron density images should be either calculated and formatted as 
   described in [Electron density generation](#electron-density-generation) 
   section or downloaded elsewhere: 
   [Density images used to train the current model](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w84cqv9z0vl4f0y/density_npy.tar.xz?dl=0) (28,6 GB), 
   [Density images used to train the current model (unshifted)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bavwbo78h3ay7ld/density.tar.xz?dl=0) (1,1 GB), 
   [Full example of the data folder for inference](https://github.com/Shorku/rhnet_models/raw/main/test_data.tar.xz)

   * To perform **both training and inference** the script expects the dataset
   folder to contain the following files:
     * `polymer_mass.csv` (required for training and prediction)
     * `solvent_mass.csv` (required for training and prediction)
     * `cubes` folder with the electron density images
   * optionally if the model is intended to use solvent macroparameters:
     * `solvent_macro_features.csv` (optional for training and prediction)
   * To perform **inference** the script also expects the dataset folder 
   to contain the following file:
     * `to_predict_ranges.csv` (required for inference)
   * To perform **training** the script also expects the dataset folder 
   to contain the following files:
     * `experimental_dataset.csv` (required for training)
     * `polymers.txt` (required for training)
     * `solvents.txt` (required for training)
   * For an in-depth description of the dataset structure refer to 
   [Dataset structure](#dataset-structure) section.

   
4. Start the NGC container in the interactive mode
  
   ```bash
   mkdir local_dataset_folder_path
   mkdir local_model_folder_path
   mkdir local_logs_folder_path
   sudo docker run --runtime=nvidia -it --shm-size=<available_RAM>g --ulimit memlock=-1 --gpus all --rm --ipc=host -v local_dataset_folder_path:dataset_folder_path -v local_model_folder_path:model_folder_path -v local_logs_folder_path:logs_folder_path rhnet /bin/bash
   ```
  
   This command will launch the container and mount necessary folders: 
   * `local_dataset_folder_path` directory containing table and 
   quantum-chemical data as a volume to the `dataset_folder_path` directory 
   inside the container 
   * `local_model_folder_path` directory, containing a pre-trained model or 
   checkpoints to the `model_folder_path` directory in the container.  
   * `local_logs_folder_path` directory containing log-files to the
   `logs_folder_path` directory inside the container. 
   
   These will be accessible both from the host and docker container.

   **Note**, *`--shm-size=100g` for example will share 100 GiB between the host
   and your docker container: pnet preloads the quantum chemical data to the 
   RAM and in the case of huge datasets will need more RAM, than the default 
   amount. Make sure to adjust this parameter.*

   
### Run

1. Inference

   ```bash
   python3 main.py --load_model --exec_mode predict --data_dir dataset_folder_path --model_dir model_folder_path --log_dir logs_folder_path --log_name logfile_name --use_only_mw --use_only_amorph --augment 1 --batch_size 32
   ```
   `--load_model` tells the script to load an already trained and saved model. 
   It will override `--model` option.

   `--data_dir` specifies the path to a folder with the data for prediction. 
   Note, the data for fit and prediction has slightly different format as 
   described in [Dataset for inference](#dataset-for-inference) section.

   `--model_dir` specifies the path to a folder with a pre-trained Keras model.
   As usual, it is expected to contain `saved_model` folder
   (`model_folder_path/saved_model`).

   `--log_dir` specifies the path to a folder where the calculated data will be
   stored.

   `--use_only_mw` tells the script to use only Mw (weight-average molecular 
   mass) feature and to omit Mn (number-average molecular mass) feature, which 
   is the way the current model is trained. Should be used with our pre-trained
   models.

   `--use_only_amorph` tells the script to use only amorphous polymers and omit
   crystallinity feature. Should be used with our pre-trained models.

   `--augment 1` tells the script to skip rotations and shifts of the electron
   density images, which is unnecessary for inference.


2. Training
   
   **Current model**
   ```bash
   python3 main.py --data_dir /data --model_dir /results --batch_size 8 --epochs 100 --exec_mode train --log_name multikernel --augment 25 --model multikernel --api builtin --use_only_mw --use_only_amorph --store_density cache --xla --amp --activation elu --learning_rate 0.000005 --save_model --log_dir tb_logs/fit --make_even --eval_define val_pairs.csv --checkpoint_every 20 --dnn_l2 0.00001 --cnn_l2 0.00001
   ```
   **Basic:**
   
   ```bash
   python3 main.py --exec_mode train --data_dir /data --model_dir /results --batch_size 24 --epochs 20 --log_dir /logs --log_name mylog --augment 25
   ```
   `--batch_size` tells the script the size of mini batch

   `--epochs` tells the script the number of epochs (how many times the whole 
   set will be consumed)*

   `--augment` tells the script how many shifted/rotated electron density 
   3D images are available.**

   **Mixed precision:**

   (lower memory consumption, faster evaluation)
   ```bash
   python3 main.py --exec_mode train --xla --amp  --data_dir /data --model_dir /results --batch_size 24 --epochs 20 --log_dir /logs --log_name mylog --augment 25
   ```
   `--xla` tells the script to enable accelerated linear algebra optimization

   `--amp` tells the script to enable automatic mixed precision

   **With L2 regularization:**
   
   ```bash
   python3 main.py --dnn_l2 0.005 --cnn_l2 0.005 --exec_mode train --data_dir /data --model_dir /results --batch_size 24 --epochs 20 --log_dir /logs --log_name mylog --augment 25
   ```
   `--dnn_l2` tells the script to include regularizing term calculated using 
              the weights of the dense part of the net in loss function

   `--cnn_l2` tells the script to include regularizing term calculated using 
              the weights of the convolutional part of the net in loss function
  
   The result will be stored in a checkpoint file in `./results` folder, if 
   `--save_model` of `--checkpoint_every` options are invoked.

   **Notes:**

   * By default, the script will try to balance the set. First it will generate 
   a lookup table, which for every experimental point will contain all possible 
   combinations of conformations and augmentations of the corresponding polymer
   and solvent. Then every epoch it will sample a random subset so that all 
   polymer-solvent pairs will have equal shares within the sampled set, while 
   all experimental points will also have equal shares within their 
   polymer-solvent pairs share. 
   * Augmentation (shift and rotation of the images) is computationally heavy 
   and by default is supposed to be done by a separate script outside the 
   training procedure. The number of available pre-shifted images should be
   defined by `--augment` option. On-the-fly augmentation is turned on using
   `--augment_onthefly`. With on-the-fly augmentation the RhNet script will
   randomly shift and rotate each image each time while prefetching the next 
   batch of the data. This will create a bottleneck which could be to some 
   extent mitigated using parallel execution of data generator (defined by
   `--parallel_preproc` keyword)

 
3. Training with validation.
  
   The model can be evaluated while training by passing the `--eval_split` 
   flag:
     
   ```bash
   python3 main.py --exec_mode train --eval_split <natural number> --evaluate_every 1 --data_dir /data --model_dir /results --batch_size 24 --epochs 20 --log_dir /logs --log_name mylog --augment 25
   ```
  
   `--eval_split n` will tell the script to split the set into training and 
   validation subsets. `1/n` fraction of the total set will be assigned to the 
   validation set, while the rest will be used for training.

   `--evaluate_every n` will tell the script to evaluate the models performance 
   every `n` epochs.

   **Notes:**

   * validation set can also be defined using `--eval_define my_val_pairs.csv` 
   option, see [General parameters](#general-parameters) section for details.
   
 
4. Training with cross-validation.
  
   To perform n-fold cross-validation a `--fold` flag should be passed:
     
   ```bash
   python3 main.py --exec_mode train --fold <natural/number> --evaluate_every 1 --data_dir /data --model_dir /results --batch_size 24 --epochs 20 --log_dir /logs --log_name mylog --augment 25
   ```
  
   `--fold n` will tell the script to randomly split the set into `n` subsets. 
   Next the script will `n` times train the model from scratch using each 
   subset as a validation set.
   
   **Notes:**

   * cross-validation feature wasn't tested for a long time, sorry

    validation subset. Overrides `--eval_split`. DEFAULT: `None`.
* `--holdout_define`: Path to the `.csv` file which defines the polymer-solvent
    pairs to be excluded from the dataset during the current run. The `.csv` 
    file has the same structure as described for `--eval_define`. (DEFAULT:
    `None`)
* `--restrict_to_define`: Path to the `.csv` file which defines the 
    polymer-solvent pairs to be used during the current run (everything else

    checkpoints if set to `0`. DEFAULT: `0`.
* `--initial_epoch`: Set initial epoch for model fitting. Applied only to 
    functional models. This option is only needed for correct callbacks

    numbers in the dataset
* `data/geometries.tar.xz` archive provides **geometries of solvents and 
    polymers'** repeating units (in `XYZ` format) which were used to calculate 
    electron densities. Filenames in the archive use the following convention:
  * Filenames contain four indexes separated by `_`
  * The first index is a letter: either `p`(olymer) or `s`(olvent)
  * Second index is an ID number of polymer specified in 
      `data/list_of_polymers.csv` or solvent specified in 
      `data/list_of_solvents.csv`
  * Third index if for the choice of a particular repeating unit of a polymer
      and is always 1 for solvents.
  * Fourth index enumerates conformational isomers 
  * For example `p_3_2_1.xyz` will contain geometry of:
    * polymer, as it starts with `p`
    * polyethylene (-CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>-)<sub>n</sub> which is

    fitting of models with other than electron density molecular 
    representations. Dangling bonds in polymers' repeating units are caped with
    Fr-atoms. Filenames in the archive use the following convention:
  * Filenames contain two indexes separated by `_`

2,1,114.16
...
```
* `data/solvents.txt` contains python dictionary defining the number of
    available conformations for each solvent: 
```bash
{solvent_ID: num_confs,
 solvent_ID: num_confs,
 ...}
 
 For example:
 
 {1:  1, 
  2:  1, 
  3:  3,
 ...}
```
* `data/solvent_mass.csv` defines the molar masses (g/mol) of the solvents:

```

### Example assembly

![RhNet_xyexample](images/xyexample.png)

A single example consists of two images: polymer repeating unit's density and 
solvent's density, and a vector (table row) of macroscopic features such as 
pressure, temperature, polymers molar mass, etc.

The density images have two channels: electron density and spin density 
channels. Spin density channel is used mostly to represent position and
orientation of the polymer repeating units' dangling bonds, which connect them
to the other repeating units in a real polymer. 

Available macroscopic features (listed in the order they are expected by
the model) are:
```python
features = ['mn',          # polymer number average molar weight
            'mw',          # polymer weight average molar weight
            'cryst',       # polymer crystallinity degree
            'pressure',    # experimental pressure
            'temperature', # experimental temperature
            'tg',          # polymer glass transition temperature
            'dens',        # polymer density
            'bt',          # solvent boiling temperature
            'ct',          # solvent critical temperature
            'cp'           # solvent critical pressure
            ]
```
Some of the features can be omitted using command line arguments 
(see [Advanced](#advanced) section). The current version of the pre-trained 
model uses `['mw', 'pressure', 'temperature']` set of features.

The model's **input signature** is as follows:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

fit_input_signature= \
    ((tf.TensorSpec(shape=(img_dim,                # polymer electron/spin 
                           img_dim,                # density image 
                           img_dim, 2),
                    dtype=precision),
      tf.TensorSpec(shape=(img_dim,                # solvent electron/spin 
                           img_dim,                # density image 
                           img_dim, 2),
                    dype=precision),
      tf.TensorSpec(shape=(macro_feature_number,), # polymer/solvent macro
                    dtype=precision)),            # features
     tf.TensorSpec(shape=(1,),                     # value to be predicted   
                   dtype=precision),)

inference_input_signature= \
    ((tf.TensorSpec(shape=(img_dim,                # polymer electron/spin 
                           img_dim,                # density image 
                           img_dim, 2),
                    dtype=precision),
      tf.TensorSpec(shape=(img_dim,                # solvent electron/spin 
                           img_dim,                # density image 
                           img_dim, 2),
                    dype=precision),
      tf.TensorSpec(shape=(macro_feature_number,), # polymer/solvent macro
                    dtype=precision),))           # features
```
The current pre-trained model uses `img_dim = 80`, `macro_feature_number = 3`. 
By default `precision = tf.float32`, if `--amp` key is invoked 
`precision = tf.float16`. 

### Dataset for inference
The `data/` folder should contain the following files:
* `to_predict_ranges.csv`
* `list_of_polymers.csv`
* `list_of_solvents.csv`
* `polymer_mass.csv`
* `solvent_mass.csv`
* `cubes` directory with density images

For example, suppose the `to_predict_ranges.csv` file looks like:
```bash
polymer,solvent,mn,mw,cryst,tg,dens,pmin,pmax,npstep,tmin,tmax,ntstep
13,1,29000,140000,0,243,1.2304,2,20,19,393.15,453.15,3
```
It will request calculation of absorption of a gas with ID number `1` in a
polymer with ID number `13`:
* `cubes` directory should contain polymer repeating unit density in `p_13.npy`
    file and solvent molecule density in `s_1.npy` file
* Number average (`mn`) and weight average (`mw`) molar weights of the polymer
    are set to 29000 and 140000 respectively
* Degree of crystallinity (`cryst`) is set to 0 (ignored in the current model)
* Polymer glass transition temperature (`tg`) is set to 243 K (ignored in the 
    current model)
* Polymer density (`dens`) is set to 1.2304 g/cm3 (ignored in the current 
    model)
* The model will be applied to calculate `ntstep` isotherms with minimal 
    temperature `tmin` and maximal temperature `tmax`. In this example at 
    393.15 K, 423.15 K, and 453.15 K.
* Each isotherm will be calculated for pressures in range `pmin` - `pmax` with 
    `npstep` points: at 2 MPa, 3 MPa... 20 MPa

### Dataset for training
The `data/` folder should contain the following files:
* `experimental_dataset.csv`
* `list_of_polymers.csv`
* `list_of_solvents.csv`
* `polymer_mass.csv`
* `solvent_mass.csv`
* `polymers.txt`
* `solvents.txt`
* `cubes` directory with density images
    Refer to [Dataset overview](#dataset-overview) section for details

## Electron density generation
Repository contains a script to generate and optionally augment 3D images of 
electron density distribution in a format suitable for the RhNet model.

### qcdata_gen overview
The qcdata_gen script is intended to perform two main tasks:

- generate quantum-chemical data for training
- generate quantum-chemical data for inference

The workflows in these cases differ. For a general description of training 
data generation refer to the paper from [Reference](#reference) section. 

### qcdata_gen requirements
To run the script one will need:
* [ORCA](https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/index.php) - An ab initio, DFT and 
    semiempirical SCF-MO package
* [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/)* - Open-Source Cheminformatics Software
* [XTB](https://xtb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html)* - 
    Semiempirical Extended Tight-Binding Program Package
* [conformers](http://limor1.nioch.nsc.ru/quant/program/conformers/)* - a 
    standalone script for identical structures filtering

**Notes:**
* RDKit, XTB, and conformers are only needed for training dataset generation 
 
### qcdata_gen setup
Download and install prerequisites:
* Generation of both training and inference data requires [ORCA](https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/index.php)
    package. ORCA is available as a ready-to-use binary package and doesn't 
    require (for the time being) compilation and installation. For more details
    refer to the official documentation or 
    [other resources](https://sites.google.com/site/orcainputlibrary/setting-up-orca).
    There are two options for the script to locate ORCA executables. 
    Either ORCA path can be retrieved from $ORCA environmental variable, or it can
    be provided as a command-line option `--orca_path <orca_path>`
* [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/) is only needed to generate training examples.
    Here is RDKit installation example that worked for me (make sure to use your
    username, correct python path, and most recent RDKit version):
```bash
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
sudo apt install zlib1g-dev
sudo apt install libfreetype6-dev libfreetype6
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
sudo apt install cmake
wget https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/archive/Release_2021_03_1.tar.gz
cd Release_2021_03_1/rdkit-Release_2021_03_1/
mkdir build
cd build
export RDBASE=/home/username/Release_2021_03_1/rdkit-Release_2021_03_1
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/username/Release_2021_03_1/rdkit-Release_2021_03_1/lib
cmake -D PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 -D RDK_INSTALL_INTREE=OFF -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/username/rdkit ..
make -j 12
make install
ln -s /home/username/rdkit/lib/python3.8/site-packages/rdkit /home/username/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages
```
* [XTB](https://xtb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html) is only needed
    to generate training examples. For XTB setup instructions refer to the 
    [documentation](https://xtb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html). Once 
    downloaded and compiled be sure to make it executable and move it to the 
    ORCA directory:
```bash
chmod +x xtb
mv xtb orca_path/otool_xtb
```
* [conformers](http://limor1.nioch.nsc.ru/quant/program/conformers/) script is 
    only needed to generate training examples. There are two options for the 
    qdata_gen script to locate conformers script. Either conformers path can be 
    retrieved from $CONFORMERS environmental variable, or it can be provided as 
    a command-line option `--conf_path <conf_path>`. Once downloaded make it 
    executable:
```bash
chmod +x conformers
```

### qcdata_gen run for inference data
The script can consume multiple `.xyz` files from the input directory, perform 
single-point DFT calculations and convert resulting electron and spin-densities
to `.npy` format suitable for the RhNet model. 
```bash
python3 qcdata_gen/main.py --exec_mode cube_to_predict --pal <ncores> --mol_dir <input_path> --out_dir <output_path> --orca_path <orca_path> --use_name_convention
```
* `--exec_mode cube_to_predict` will instruct the script to perform only 
    single-point calculations on the user-supplied geometries. No shifts or 
    rotations will be applied to electron densities
* `--use_name_convention` option suggests a structure with xyz-filename 
    starting with: `s_` to be a solvent molecule and with `p_` to be a polymer
    repeating unit with two dangling bonds
* `--pal <ncores>` number of CPU cores to use in DFT calculations
* `--mol_dir <input_path>` a directory where the script will look for input `.xyz` files 
* `--out_dir <output_path>` a directory where temporary files and the results will be
    stored
* `--orca_path <orca_path>`

### qcdata_gen run for training data
The script can consume multiple .mol files from the input directory.

**Basic:**
```bash
python3 qcdata_gen/main.py --exec_mode conf_and_cube --pal <ncores> --mol_dir <input_path> --out_dir <output_path> --orca_path <orca_path> --conf_path <conf_path> --use_name_convention --rdkit_nconf <nconf> --rdkit_thresh <thresh>
```
* `--exec_mode conf_and_cube` will instruct the script to generate a number of
    conformations using RDKit, optimize geometries using RDKit and ORCA 
    (consequently on the XTB and DFT levels) and finally perform single-point
    calculations to generate density images. By default, with translational and 
    rotational augmentation
* `--pal <ncores>` number of CPU cores to use in DFT calculations
* `--mol_dir <input_path>` a directory where the script will look for input 
    .mol files 
* `--out_dir <output_path>` a directory where temporary files and the results 
    will be stored
* `--orca_path <orca_path>` a directory where ORCA binaries are stored. Can 
    also be defined in `ORCA` environment variable
* `--conf_path <conf_path>` a directory where `conformers` script is stored. 
    Can also be defined in `CONFORMERS` environment variable
* `--use_name_convention` option suggests a structure with xyz-filename 
    starting with: `s_` to be a solvent molecule and with `p_` to be a polymer
    repeating unit with two dangling bonds
* `--rdkit_nconf <nconf>` maximal number of conformers generated by RDKit
* `--rdkit_thresh <thresh>`  conformer difference threshold for RDKit


### Parameters 
* `--exec_mode`: The execution mode of the script:
  * `conf`: search for conformations and optimize their geometries
  * `cube`: perform single-point calculations and generate density images
  * `conf_and_cube`: (DEFAULT) search for conformations, optimize their 
      geometries, perform single-point calculations and generate density images

* `--out_dir`: a directory where temporary files and the results will be stored
* `--pal`: number of CPU cores to use in DFT calculations. DEFAULT: `12`
* `--conf_level`: Highest level of geometry optimization. By default, the 
    script will successively optimize geometries at molecular mechanics level 
    in RDKit, then at XTB and DFT levels in ORCA
  * `ff`: optimize geometries at molecular mechanics level in RDKit only
  * `semi`: optimize geometries at molecular mechanics level in RDKit and XTB 
      level in ORCA

      and XTB and DFT levels in ORCA 
  * `ff_dft`: omit XTB optimization
* `--dft_scheme`: Choice of DFT methods for optimization and electron density 
    calculation (DEFAULT: `normal`):
  * `normal`: `r2SCAN-3c` for optimization and `B3LYP/def2-TZVP` for density 
  * `fast`: `B97-3c` for optimization and `PBE/def2-SVP` for density 
* `--use_name_convention`: suggest structure with xyz-filename starting with
    `s_` to be a solvent molecule and with `p_` to be a polymer repeating unit.
    In polymer repeating unit geometries 8 last atoms are suggested to be 
    screening Me- groups and will be removed for single-point calculation and 
    density image generation
* `--component`: suggest all structures in xyz-files to be (DEFAULT: `None`):
  * `solvent`: solvent - calculate images for the whole molecule
  * `polymer`: polymer - 8 last atoms are suggested to be screening Me- groups 
      and will be removed for single-point calculation and density image 
      generation

    generated by ORCA will have `--extend_cube`-times better resolution than 
    requested by `--cube_n`. Next density images resolution will be decreased 
    to the target value via averaging instead of interpolation. DEFAULT: `6`
* `--orca_path`: ORCA binaries location, can also be taken from environmental 
    variable `ORCA`
* `--conf_path`: CONFORMERS script location, can also be taken from 
    environmental variable `CONFORMERS`

## Notes

### Excluded data sources

- 10.3390/polym14030596. Reason: Table 2 disagrees with Figure 11.
- 10.1002/pen.760211409. Reason: microsphere samples seem to be too micro =)
- 10.1016/j.supflu.2022.105534. Reason: In section 2.3.1 it is stated, that
the (P and T independent) integral molar absorptivity was used, while in 
section 2.3.2.2 and Figure 5 the (P and T dependent?) intensity based 
extinction coefficient is clearly used. 
- 10.1002/polb.22209. Reason: the measured data deviates from other sources
by up to 100%.
- 10.1080/19443994.2014.981931. Reason: LiCl was not removed from mPBI samples
- 10.1021/ma302155j. Reason: temperature is specified as "room temperature"
- 10.1016/j.supï¬u.2013.12.021. Reason: PEG melting temperatures are quite 
likely wrongly determined to fall in range 410-440 K, sorption isotherms have
strange discontinuities

### Other notes

- 10.1002/polb.1181. Dual mode sorption parameters are apparently incorrect
